The efficiency our algorithm in the worst case would be Theta(n^3).

Checking whether a company wants to hire a programmer--the inside
of the while loop from lines 108 to 130--is Theta(n). (This is because
of operations like "getPreferredCompany" and "indexOf" take linear time.)

And, we check if a company wants to hire a programmer at most n^2 times;
after each programmer interviews with a company, they cross that company
off of their list, never to return. So, it's impossible to conduct more
interviews than (the number of programmers) times (the number of
companies), which is n^2.

Thus, in the worst case where each programmer's options are
examined and then reexamined, the program would run in n^3 time.
